- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dekumori -- John
- 👀 I’m interested in music, anime, and computers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and music theory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much; all I've really done is html, basic, and some light python, so I won't be very helpful unfortunately.
- 📫 How to reach me (I don't have public facing contact info yet)
